the new year is not very good. At the beginning of the year of 2021, the covid emerged again in our city. In order to control the spread of the virus,
the whole city has been shutdown, all the people should stay at home. I donot know if this is the most effective methods and policies to halt the extend
of the covid virus, but i know the majority of residents have been impacted. i really miss the normal life.

Through the tough study of english,i have got 7 degree of ielts. so i apply the excellent university like ucd and tcd. but maybe in the next year, 
all the classes will been lectured online, i really wonder why whether it is worthwhile to go to ireland to attend the courses. 

the next thing is our baby is going to birth in next and next month. i am a little looking forward to the birth of the baby.
