Recently,i spend most of my spare time in studying English to prepare for the exam of ielts.I 

However there is no precise news about whether or not the ielts exam in June will be cancelled.So i also enroll the exam in August.

My wife and i have make the plans for our future,we will immigrate to Canada or Australia(Canada is the first choice).In Canada,i will study in University to get a master degree,then choose a clean and quiet city to settle and live there in the rest of our life.

i have graduate from university for almost ten years, and in my work,i seldom use english,so i encounter a lot of problems in study english.Finally,i find the college English books,review all the articles in there and redo all the homework after each article.this is really help me a lot. i also wonder my English level at college is so good,if i participate the ielts exam at that time,i would worry about the exam.

the work in company is heavy too.When i goto work,i almost have to concentrate all my attension to the daily work to finish the requirement the boos ordered.Luckyly,there are some new knowledges i learn in my work,which extend my mind.


Last,may the exam in June will not be cancelled.God bless.
