yesterday,i finished my ielts exam,but i have to wait 10 days to know the result.i cancelled the exam in the august.
i just want to rearrange the plan until i know the result,however i will not study the study of english.

my wife got pregnant about a month ago.i really happy for that,even though i have to response for all the household
chores.Autually,i am busy everyday.In the morning,i have to get up earlier to prepare the breakfast,then i will take
her to work.After a day's work,i will take her at her company,then back to home together,after that,i have to prepare
for the dinner,then prepare for the lunch in nextday to take. after finish all the works,i still have to prepare for 
ielts exam.

since i have graduated from the univercity for about 10 years,i almost forget all the english knowledges,the grammar
system,the vocabularies and so on. it is really hard for me to relearn english.

if i can get a high score in the ielts exam,then i will finish two goals in this year.
