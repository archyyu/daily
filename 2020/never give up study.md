i personally think none should give up study. study is a life long routine.

i know some of my friends want to make a complete career change,and they ask me 
the opinions about it.i encourage them to make their own choice,follow their heart.
but i also know they have abandon the study after graduating from the school,or even 
in the school,they didnot study the curriculums by heart.

Some friends of my wife live in Canada,they do some low labour jobs(i am not discriminate agaist 
the low labour jobs),autually they all graduated from university and got the bachelor degree,and 
before immigrated to Canana,they all had the spendid job.however after the immigration,most of them
have to do the low labour jobs,due to the barrier of language.

i donot know why they try to master the english?

maybe it is a little difficult for the middle-age people to master the english,but 
since they are able to do the physical work,if the study of english is more complex and harder
than the physical work?

i absolutely donot think so.i think the maybe because they cannot torelate the active pain,but can endure 
the passive pain.

i think i will never stop learning.
